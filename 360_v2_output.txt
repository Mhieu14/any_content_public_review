# 1.5 Using Excel to find best-fit curves

Overview. Link to set up but unworked worksheets used in this section ${ }^{1}$ Link to worksheets used in this section ${ }^{2}$[^0]

In Section 1.1-1.2 we looked at useful mathematical models and formulas that we anticipate seeing repeatedly in the business environment. If we are given equations that model the processes we are interested in, then this approach works. What happens though if we are not given equations? Many important functions in business are quite often defined by data. Examples include past sales, material costs, and consumer demand.

If we are given a data set, we can find a best fitting curve. A straightforward approach is to assume that the data represents the output of a nice formula. In real life applications, we will often see that so-called "noise" can complicate the situation. (Noise is a technical term to describe external unpredictable factors that may cause your data to deviate form the model. For example, if I am looking at sales at a fast food restaurant, our model will have noise from traffic jams and bad weather outside.) For the purpose of this course we will assume that the data will be reasonably nice, although some noise may be evident. The problem of producing a best fitting curve to data can be broken into two pieces:

1. We need to decide what kind of curve, or what model we want to use.

2. We want to be able to set the parameters (the constants) in the model to give the best fit.

Coming up with a theoretical reason why we want to use a particular model in a given case forms the content of a large number of your business courses, both courses you have already taken and courses you are yet to take. The models that come up repeatedly in the theoretical courses are given names and used without redoing the theoretical foundation for the model. (This is why we introduced the normal distribution and the logistic growth function, neither of which looks like a simple equation.) In this course, we will be happy with simple heuristic arguments on which model to choose.

The second half of the problem is deciding how to choose the parameters to give the curve that does the best job of fitting the data. A moment of reflection shows deciding on the correct definition of "best fitting" is a nontrivial task beyond the scope of this course. For the time being we will accept the standard definition:

The best fitting curve minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the measured and predicted values.

We will come back to that definition later in the course, when we know more calculus, but for now we simply note that it is the standard definition, and is used by Excel. Instead, we will focus on using Excel to produce a best fitting curve of the appropriate model. Excel has a preprogrammed feature that will find the best fitting equation for a data set for a select number of functions:

- Linear model

- Exponential model

- Polynomial model

- Logarithmic model

- Power model

We will show how to find an equation for a data set, assuming we know what model would be the best one to represent the data.

### 1.5.1.1 Find the line

For a first example, we are running a widget factory and have the following data on employee performance:

| 1 | A | B | C | D |  | F | G | H | I | J | K |
| ---: | :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | Hours Worked | 43 | 43 | 44 | 35 | 36 | 44 | 41 | 45 | 36 | 41 |
| 2 | Widgets Produced | 255 | 256 | 263 | 211 | 218 | 265 | 247 | 273 | 221 | 241 |

(A parenthetical note: In economics, widget is a placeholder name for a generic manufactured device. It is only in recent times that it has also become a small computer GUI unit.)

We would like a formula for widgets produced as a function of hours worked Since we can see two entries each, for 36,43 , and 44 hours worked, there cannot be a function that hits all our data exactly. While we expect a linear function, we are not surprised if there is random noise, as a worker may take a break, or be particularly focused on a given day. We start by creating a scatterplot for my data.

We right click (control-click on a Mac) on one of the data points and we get a contextual menu. We select Add Trendline.[^1]

### 1.5.1.2 Produce the equation of the line

When adding a trend line, we need to select from a number of options. The first option concerns the mathematical model we want to choose. Given that we suspect the number of widget produced will be roughly proportional to the hours worked, we want to use a linear model, so we make that choice. Under options, we want to display the equation on the chart.

## Figure 1.5.3

We have added a linear trend line to the graph and can also see the equation for

the line. We could use that equation to plan how many hours we want our workers on the job based on the number of widgets we expect to sell.

<!-- START OF EXAMPLE -->
### 1.5.1.3 Bring the equation of the line back to the chart

Having found a best fitting line, I want to copy the equation back into my spreadsheet and to be able to compare the values in my data with the projections from my equation. You should notice that the equation Excel produces in the chart is written in standard mathematical notation, while the corresponding equation in cell B3 is in Excel notation. (In Excel notation we need a symbol for multiplication rather than simply putting a number and variable together. In Excel notation, we also use a cell reference, $\mathrm{B1}$, rather than a variable, $\mathrm{x}$.)

Figure 1.5.4 Video presentation of this example

When finding the best fitting curve to data we have gathered, we need to pay attention to the model we have chosen and to the range to which we want to apply it. In our example, the linear fit looks pretty good. However, we should be careful about using it on too wide a domain. According to our model, a worker who works no[^2]hours produces 12.52 widgets a week, which is obviously silly. In the other direction, it predicts that a worker who worked $168(=7 \times 24)$ hours a week would produce almost 970 widgets, instead of predicting a collapse from exhaustion.

The other issue is the choice of a model. We chose a linear model. An argument could easily be made for a proportional model. (A worker who works no hours produces no widgets.) We can switch to the proportional model by setting the $y$ intercept to 0 in options for the trend line. Then the equation is

$($ Widgets Produced $)=6.00026 *($ Hours Worked $)$

instead of our original equation of

$($ Widgets Produced $)=5.6975 *($ Hours Worked $)+12.54$.

We should also be careful about trying to get a better fit by using an inappropriate model. In our case, we can get a better fit by allowing the curve to be a 6th degree polynomial. However the resulting equation does not make sense. It predicts that a worker will produce about quarter million widgets with a 1-hour work week, and -1500 widgets with a 55 -hour work week.
