# 8.2 Integration by Parts

Integration by parts is an integration method that enables us to find antiderivatives of certain functions for which our previous antidifferentiation methods fail, such as $\ln (x)$ and $\arctan (x)$, as well as antiderivatives of certain products of functions, such as $x^{2} \ln (x)$ and $e^{x} \sin (x)$. It leads to many of the general integral formulas in Appendix I and (next to $u$-substitution) it is one most powerful and frequently used of antidifferentiation techniques.

The Integration by Parts formula for integrals arises from the Product Rule for derivatives. Recall that for functions $u=u(x)$ and $v=v(x)$, the Product Rule says:

$$
\frac{d}{d x}[u \cdot v]=u \cdot \frac{d v}{d x}+v \cdot \frac{d u}{d x}
$$

If we integrate both sides of this equation with respect to $x$ we get:

$$
u \cdot v=\int u \cdot \frac{d v}{d x} d x+\int v \cdot \frac{d u}{d x} d x
$$

Solving for the first of the two integrals on the right side, yields:

$$
\int u \cdot \frac{d v}{d x} d x=u \cdot v-\int v \cdot \frac{d u}{d x} d x
$$

At first, this formula may not appear very promising, as it merely exchanges one integration problem for another. But in certain situations, if we choose $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ carefully, this formula exchanges a difficult integral for an easier one. We can restate the formula in slightly more compact form using differentials.

## Integration by Parts Formula

If $u, v, u^{\prime}$ and $v^{\prime}$ are continuous functions,

$$
\text { then } \int u d v=u \cdot v-\int v d u
$$

## Integration by Parts Formula (Definite Integrals)

If $u, v, u^{\prime}$ and $v^{\prime}$ are continuous functions,

then $\int_{a}^{b} u d v=[u \cdot v]_{a}^{b}-\int_{a}^{b} v d u$

<!-- START OF EXAMPLE -->
Example 1. Use integration by parts to evaluate $\int x \cos (x) d x$ and $\int_{0}^{\pi} x \cos (x) d x$ (see margin for a graphical interpretation).

Solution. Our first step is to write this integral in the form required by the Integration by Parts formula, $\int u d v$. If we let $u=x$, then we must have $d v=\cos (x) d x$ so that $u d v$ completely represents the integrand $x \cos (x)$. We also need to calculate $d u$ and $v$ :

$$
u=x \Rightarrow d u=d x \quad \text { and } \quad d v=\cos (x) d x \Rightarrow v=\sin (x)
$$

Putting these pieces into the Integration by Parts formula, we have:

$$
\int x \cdot \cos (x) d x=x \cdot \sin (x)-\int \sin (x) d x=x \cdot \sin (x)+\cos (x)+C
$$

To check this result, differentiate the answer to verify that:

$$
[x \sin (x)+\cos (x)]^{\prime}=x \cos (x)
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{\pi} x \cdot \cos (x) d x & =[x \cdot \sin (x)+\cos (x)]_{0}^{\pi} \\
& =[\pi \sin (\pi)+\cos (\pi)]-[0 \cdot \sin (0)+\cos (0)]=-1-1
\end{aligned}
$$

or -2 , which appears reasonable based on the area interpretation of this integral in the margin graph on the previous page.

Integration by parts allowed us to exchange the problem of evaluating $\int x \cos (x) d x$ for the much easier problem of evaluating $\int \sin (x) d x$.
<!-- END OF EXAMPLE -->

Practice 1. Use the Integration by Parts formula on $\int x \cos (x) d x$ with $u=\cos (x)$ and $d v=x d x$. Why does this lead to a poor exchange?

<!-- START OF EXAMPLE -->
Example 2. Evaluate $\int x e^{3 x} d x$ and $\int_{0}^{1} x e^{3 x} d x$.

Solution. The integrand is a product of two functions, so it is reasonable to use integration by parts to search for an antiderivative. If $u=x \Rightarrow d u=d x$, then $d v=e^{3 x} d x \Rightarrow v=\frac{1}{3} e^{3 x}$. Inserting these expressions into the Integration by Parts formula, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int x e^{3 x} d x & =x \cdot \frac{1}{3} e^{3 x}-\int \frac{1}{3} e^{3 x} d x=\frac{x}{3} e^{3 x}-\frac{1}{9} e^{3 x}+C \\
\Rightarrow \int_{0}^{1} x e^{3 x} d x & =\left[\frac{x}{3} e^{3 x}-\frac{1}{9} e^{3 x}\right]_{0}^{1}=\left[\frac{1}{3} e^{3}-\frac{1}{9} e^{3}\right]-\left[0-\frac{1}{9}\right]=\frac{2}{9} e^{3}+\frac{1}{9}
\end{aligned}
$$

or about 4.57 .

In the previous Example another valid choice would have been $u=e^{3 x}$ and $d v=x d x$, but that choice results in an integral that is more difficult than the original one: $d u=3 e^{3 x} d x$ and $v=\frac{1}{2} x^{2}$, so the Integration by Parts formula yields:

$$
\int x e^{3 x} d x=e^{3 x} \cdot \frac{1}{2} x^{2}-\int \frac{1}{2} x^{2} \cdot 3 e^{3 x} d x
$$

which exchanges $\int x e^{3 x} d x$ for the more difficult integral $\int \frac{3}{2} x^{2} e^{3 x} d x$.

If you cannot find a $v$ for your original choice of $d v$, try a different $u$ and $d v$.
<!-- END OF EXAMPLE -->
<!-- END OF TOPIC -->

Why are absolute value signs not needed in the last term?

We can now include the antiderivative of $\arctan (x)$ in our list of antiderivatives in Appendix I.

Practice 2. Evaluate $\int x \sin (x) d x$ and $\int x e^{5 x} d x$.

Once you have chosen $u$ and $d v$ to represent the integrand as $u d v$, you need to calculate $d u$ and $v$. The $d u$ calculation is usually easy, but finding $v$ from $d v$ can be difficult for some choices of $d v$. In practice, you need to select $u$ so that the remaining $d v$ is simple enough that you can find $v$, the antiderivative of $d v$.

Example 3. Evaluate $\int 2 x \ln (x) d x$.

Solution. The choice $u=2 x$ seems fine until we get a little further into the process. If $u=2 x$, then $d v=\ln (x) d x$. We now need to find $d u$ and $v$. Computing $d u=2 d x$ is simple, but then we face the difficult problem of finding an antiderivative $v$ for our choice $d v=\ln (x) d x$.

The choice $u=\ln (x)$ results in easier calculations. Let $u=\ln (x)$. Then $d v=2 x d x$, so $d u=\frac{1}{x} d x$ and $v=x^{2}$. Then the Integration by Parts formula gives:

$$
\int 2 x \ln (x) d x=\ln (x) \cdot x^{2}-\int x^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{x} d x=x^{2} \ln (x)-\int x d x
$$

so the final result is $x^{2} \ln (x)-\frac{1}{2} x^{2}+C$.

## Antiderivatives of Inverse Functions

So far we have applied the Integration by Parts method to products of simple functions, but it also enables us - perhaps surprisingly - to find antiderivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions and of the logarithm (the inverse exponential function).

<!-- START OF EXAMPLE -->
Example 4. Evaluate $\int \arctan (x) d x$.

Solution. Let $u=\arctan (x)$. Then $d v=d x$, so $d u=\frac{1}{1+x^{2}} d x$ and $v=x$. Putting these expressions into the Integration by Parts formula:

$$
\int \arctan (x) d x=x \arctan (x)-\int x \cdot \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} d x
$$

We can evaluate the new integral using the substitution $w=1+x^{2} \Rightarrow$ $d w=2 x d x \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} d w=x d x$ :

$$
\int x \cdot \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} d x=\int \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{w} d w=\frac{1}{2} \ln (|w|)+K=\frac{1}{2} \ln \left(1+x^{2}\right)+K
$$

Combining these results:

$$
\int \arctan (x) d x=x \arctan (x)-\frac{1}{2} \ln \left(1+x^{2}\right)+C
$$

or $x \arctan (x)-\ln \left(\sqrt{1+x^{2}}\right)+C$.
<!-- END OF EXAMPLE -->
<!-- END OF TOPIC -->

Practice 3. Evaluate $\int \ln (x) d x$ and $\int_{1}^{e} \ln (x) d x$.

Note the following about the Integration by Parts formula:

- Once you choose $u$, then $d v$ is completely determined.

- Because you need to find an antiderivative of $d v$ to get $v$, pick $u$ and $d v$ with this in mind.

- Integration by parts allows you to trade one integral for another. If the new integral is more difficult than the original integral, then you have made a poor choice of $u$ and $d v$. Try a different choice for $u$ and $d v$ (or try a different technique).

- To evaluate the new integral $\int v d u$ you may need to use substitution, integration by parts again, or some other technique (such as the ones discussed later in this chapter).

## General Patterns

Sometimes a single application of integration by parts yields a formula that allows us to integrate an entire family of functions.

<!-- START OF EXAMPLE -->
Example 5. Evaluate $\int x^{p} \ln (x) d x$ for any number $p \neq-1$.

Solution. Set $u=\ln (x)$ so $d v=x^{p} d x, d u=\frac{1}{x} d x$ and $v=\frac{1}{p+1} x^{p+1}$. Putting all of this into the Integration by Parts formula:

$$
\int x^{p} \ln (x) d x=\frac{1}{p+1} x^{p+1} \cdot \ln (x)-\int \frac{1}{p+1} x^{p+1} \cdot \frac{1}{x} d x
$$

This new integral becomes:

$$
\frac{1}{p+1} \int x^{p} d x=\frac{1}{p+1} \cdot \frac{1}{p+1} x^{p+1}+K=\frac{x^{p+1}}{(p+1)^{2}}+K
$$

Combining these results yields:

$$
\frac{x^{p+1}}{p+1} \ln (x)-\frac{x^{p+1}}{(p+1)^{2}}+C=\frac{x^{p+1}}{p+1}\left[\ln (x)-\frac{1}{p+1}\right]+C
$$

for any number $p$ as long as $p \neq-1$.

What happens when $p=-1$ ? Can you evaluate that integral?

<!-- START OF TOPIC -->
## Reduction Formulas

Sometimes the result of an integration-by-parts procedure still contains an integral, but a simpler one with a smaller exponent. In these situations we can reuse the resulting reduction formula until the remaining

$d v=$ rest of the integrand integral is simple enough to integrate completely.

<!-- START OF EXAMPLE -->
Example 6. Evaluate $\int x^{n} e^{x} d x$ and use the result to evaluate $\int x^{2} e^{x} d x$.

Solution. Set $u=x^{n}$ so $d v=e^{x} d x, d u=n x^{n-1} d x$ and $v=e^{x}$. The Integration by Parts formula gives

$$
\int x^{n} e^{x} d x=x^{n} e^{x}-n \int x^{n-1} e^{x} d x
$$

which is a reduction formula because we have reduced the power of $x$ by 1 , trading $\int x^{n} e^{x} d x$ for the "reduced" integral $\int x^{n-1} e^{x} d x$.

Because $\int x^{2} e^{x} d x$ matches the general pattern of $\int x^{n} e^{x} d x$ with $n=2$, we know that:

$$
\int x^{2} e^{x} d x=x^{2} e^{x}-2 \int x^{1} e^{x} d x
$$

The new integral also matches the pattern in the reduction formula (with $n=1$ this time) so we know that:

$$
\int x^{1} e^{x} d x=x^{1} e^{x}-1 \cdot \int x^{0} e^{x} d x
$$

This last integral is just $\int e^{x} d x=e^{x}+K$, so combining our results:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int x^{2} e^{x} d x & =x^{2} e^{x}-2 \int x^{1} e^{x} d x=x^{2} e^{x}-2\left[x e^{x}-\int e^{x} d x\right] \\
& =x^{2} e^{x}-2 x e^{x}+2 e^{x}+C
\end{aligned}
$$

We can also write the answer as $e^{x}\left[x^{2}-2 x+2\right]+C$.
<!-- END OF EXAMPLE -->
<!-- END OF TOPIC -->

Practice 5. Develop the reduction formula:

$$
\int x^{n} \sin (x) d x=-x^{n} \cos (x)+n \int x^{n-1} \cos (x) d x
$$

using integration by parts.

<!-- START OF TOPIC -->
## The Reappearing Integral

Sometimes the integral we are trying to evaluate shows up on both sides of the equation during our calculations in such a way that we can solve for the desired integral algebraically.

<!-- START OF EXAMPLE -->
Example 7. Evaluate $\int e^{x} \cos (x) d x$.

Solution. Let $u=e^{x}$, so $d v=\cos (x) d x, d u=e^{x} d x$ and $v=\sin (x)$ :

$$
\int e^{x} \cos (x) d x=e^{x} \sin (x)-\int e^{x} \sin (x) d x
$$

The new integral does not look any easier than the original one, but it doesn't look any worse, so let's try to evaluate the new integral using

integration by parts again. To evaluate $\int e^{x} \sin (x) d x$, let $u=e^{x}$ and $d v=\sin (x) d x$ so that $d u=e^{x} d x$ and $v=-\cos (x)$, giving us:

$$
\int e^{x} \sin (x) d x=-e^{x} \cos (x)+\int e^{x} \cos (x) d x
$$

Putting this result back into the original problem, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int e^{x} \cos (x) d x & =e^{x} \sin (x)-\int e^{x} \sin (x) d x \\
& =e^{x} \sin (x)-\left[-e^{x} \cos (x)+\int e^{x} \cos (x) d x\right] \\
& =e^{x} \sin (x)+e^{x} \cos (x)-\int e^{x} \cos (x) d x
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that $\int e^{x} \cos (x) d x$ appears on both sides of this last equation, so we can solve for that expression algebraically:

$$
2 \int e^{x} \cos (x) d x=e^{x} \sin (x)+e^{x} \cos (x)+K
$$

and, finally, divide both sides by 2 to get:

$$
\int e^{x} \cos (x) d x=\frac{1}{2}\left[e^{x} \sin (x)+e^{x} \cos (x)\right]+C
$$

which we can also write as $\frac{1}{2} e^{x}[\sin (x)+\cos (x)]+C$.

Practice 6. Evaluate $\int e^{x} \sin (x) d x$.

<!-- START OF TOPIC -->
## A Useful Shortcut

Repeated application of integration by parts, as in Example 6, can quickly become tedious, even with the aid of a reduction formula. For integrals of the form $\int x^{n} \cdot f(x) d x$ where $n$ is an integer, it is often possible to arrange the integration-by-parts ingredients in a table to allow much speedier computation.

<!-- START OF EXAMPLE -->
Example 8. Evaluate $\int x^{2} e^{3 x} d x$.

Solution. Make a table (see margin) with two columns. In the second entry of the left column, start with $u=x^{2}$ and below it list the successive derivatives of $x^{2}: 2 x, 2$ and 0 (you can stop when you get to $0)$. In the right column start with $v^{\prime}=e^{3 x}$ and below it list successive antiderivatives of $e^{3 x}: \frac{1}{3} e^{3 x}, \frac{1}{9} e^{3 x}$ and $\frac{1}{27} e^{3 x}$. Now multiply the functions in each row and add the results, alternating signs:

$$
x^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} e^{3 x}-2 x \cdot \frac{1}{9} e^{3 x}+2 \cdot \frac{1}{27} e^{3 x}-0 \cdot \frac{1}{81} e^{3 x}
$$

We can stop here, because all of the remaining terms will be 0 . Now add a constant and you have the result: $\frac{1}{3} x^{2} e^{3 x}-\frac{2}{9} x e^{3 x}+\frac{2}{27} e^{3 x}+C$.

We need an arbitrary constant on the right side of this equation because the left side is an indefinite integral.

$C=\frac{K}{2}$

Apply this new technique to the second integral in Example 6 to verify that you get the same result with the new method. Which method is faster?

This shortcut method only works when the chosen $u$ in the initial integration-by-parts setup is $x^{n}$ (so that taking several derivatives results in 0 ) and when the chosen $d v$ is a function like $e^{a x}$ or $\sin (b x)$ so that repeated antidifferentiation is fairly easy. But when this shortcut does apply, it can save you a great deal of time.
